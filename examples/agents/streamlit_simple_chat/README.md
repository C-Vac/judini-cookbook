## Notes 

- The chat history is stored in the st.session_state variable, which is a dictionary that persists across app reruns.
- The chat history is displayed on app rerun by iterating through the st.session_state.messages list and displaying each message in the appropriate chat message container.
- The chatbot response is obtained by sending a POST request to the CodeGPT Plus API with the user's message as input. The response is streamed back in chunks and displayed in the chat message container with a blinking cursor to simulate typing.
